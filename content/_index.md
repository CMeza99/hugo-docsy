This is a home the team's decisions and other long team notes saved as "[Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)".
A centralize reference will facilitate a common understanding of goals empowering the team to better prioritize, innovate, and more.
For internal brainstorming and working notes, see our shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AOWncGjVgrcTUk9PVA) folder.
